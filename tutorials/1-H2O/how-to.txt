Example molecule calculation for H2O in a box (solvated)

All needed files are included.

Run: 'sub_JDFTx.py -o H2O -t 1' 
(Alternatively, run: 'sub_JDFTx.py -h' to see additional options)
in this example folder to submit the single-step solvated H2O-in-a-box for 1 hour.

The job will run until the energy (econv) or force (fmax) convergence criteria is met,
job details will be output to 'opt.log' and 'out'.

See inputs file for job parameters.
Calculation parameters are from JDFTx: https://jdftx.org/CommandIndex.html
Additonal parameters for ASE controller can be optained by running 'sub_JDFTx.py -i True'
