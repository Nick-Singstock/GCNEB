Example adsorbate calculation for Au(111) at 0.0V with *CO adsorbed

All needed files are included.

Run: 'sub_JDFTx.py -o Au_111_CO' 
in this example folder to submit the 3-step Au(111) + *CO adsorbate convergence.

The job will run until the energy or force convergence criteria is met,
job details will be output to 'opt.log' and 'out'.

The final energy will be the last line printed in opt.log (in eV).

The adsorption energy of *CO on Au(111) can be calculated by subtracting the 
energy of the 0.0V Au(111) surface and the 0.0V CO molecule from the final energy
of this calculation. 

Projected density of states will be output for Au, C and O atoms after final single point calc.
