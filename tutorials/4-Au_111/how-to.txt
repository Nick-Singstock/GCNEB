Example surface calculation for Au(111) at 0.0V

All needed files are included.

Run: 'sub_JDFTx.py -o Au_111' 
in this example folder to submit the 3-step Au(111) surface convergence.

The job will run until the energy or force convergence criteria is met,
job details will be output to 'opt.log' and 'out'.

The final energy will be the last line printed in opt.log (in eV).
