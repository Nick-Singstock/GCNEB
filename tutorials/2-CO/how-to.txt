Example molecule calculation for CO in a box (solvated) at 0.0 V

All needed files are included.

Run: 'sub_JDFTx.py -o CO -t 1' 
(Alternatively, run: 'sub_JDFTx.py -h' to see additional options)
in this example folder to submit the single-step solvated H2O-in-a-box for 1 hour.

The job will run until the energy (econv) or force (fmax) convergence criteria is met,
job details will be output to 'opt.log' and 'out'.

See inputs file for job parameters.
